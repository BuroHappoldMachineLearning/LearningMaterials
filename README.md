# ML and Python learning material
Learning materials for Python and Machine Learning. Useful as a foundation if you want to collaborate with us.

1. [List of topics to cover for Python and Machine Learning](SummaryList.md)
2. [Code guidelines for good code](Good_code_guidelines.md)
3. If you are added to the organisation, you can find [specific development guides and FAQs here](https://github.com/BuroHappoldMachineLearning/ML_Documentation). These are in a separate repository because they are specific to our environment and workflows. Instead, this repository focuses on general topics.
