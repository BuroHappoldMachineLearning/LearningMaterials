Learning materials for Python and Machine Learning.

1. [List of topics to cover for Python and Machine Learning](SummaryList.md)
2. [Code guidelines for good code](Good_code_guidelines.md)
3. You can find [additional guides and FAQs for ML development here](https://github.com/BuroHappoldMachineLearning/ML_Documentation). These are in a separate repository because they are specific to our environment and workflows. Instead, the repository here focuses on general topics.
