# ML and Python learning material
Learning materials for Python and Machine Learning. Useful as a foundation if you want to collaborate with us.

1. [List of topics to cover for Python and Machine Learning](SummaryList.md)
2. [Code guidelines for good code](Good_code_guidelines.md)
3. [Specific development guides and FAQs](https://github.com/BuroHappoldMachineLearning/ML_Documentation) (only accessible to members of this GitHub organisation).
   These are in a separate repository as they are specific to our internal workflows and environments. Instead, this LearningMaterials repository focuses on general topics.  
   You can contact the org administrators to be added, in case you want to collaborate with us.
